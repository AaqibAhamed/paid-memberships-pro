== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I need help installing, configuring, or customizing the plugin. =
Please visit [our premium support site at http://www.paidmembershipspro.com](http://www.paidmembershipspro.com) for more documentation and our support forums.

= I found a bug in the plugin. =
Please post it in the [WordPress support forum](http://wordpress.org/tags/paid-memberships-pro?forum_id=10) and we'll fix it right away. Thanks for helping. 

= My site is broken or blank or not letting me log in after activating Paid Memberships Pro =
This is typically caused by a conflict with another plugin that is trying to redirect around the login/register pages or trying to redirect from HTTP to HTTPS, etc.

To regain access to your site, FTP to your site and rename the wp-content/plugins/paid-memberships-pro folder to wp-content/plugins/paid-memberhsips-pro-d (or anything different). Now WP will not be able to find PMPro, and you can gain access to /wp-admin/ again. From there, visit the plugins page to fully deactivate Paid Memberships Pro. (You'll want to rename the folder back to paid-memberhsips-pro again.)

Long term, you will need to find and fix the conflict. We can usually do this for you very quickly if you sign up for support at http://www.paidmembershipspro.com/pricing/ and send us your WP admin and FTP credentials.

= Does PMPro Support Multisite/Network Installs? =
"Supporting multisite" means different things to different people.

Out of the box PMPro will basically act as a stand alone plugin for each site. Each site has its own list of membership levels, members, payment settings, etc.

Our [Network/Multisite Add On](http://www.paidmembershipspro.com/add-ons/plus-add-ons/pmpro-network-multisite-membership/) allows members to choose a site name and title at checkout and will set up a network site at checkout.

Our [Network Membership Add On](http://www.paidmembershipspro.com/add-ons/plus-add-ons/pmpro-network-membership/) allows you to manage memberships at the 'Main' Network site and provide or restrict access on other Network Subsites.

If you would like more help using PMPro on a network install, sign up for support at http://www.paidmembershipspro.com.

= Does PMPro Support X? =
Not sure? You can find out by doing a bit a research.

1. [Check our compatibility page](http://www.paidmembershipspro.com/compatibility/).
2. [Check our add ons](http://www.paidmembershipspro.com/add-ons/).
3. [Do a search on our site](http://www.paidmembershipspro.com/).

== Changelog ==
= 1.8.12 =
* BUG: Fixed issue where PayPal Standard IPN requests were being rejected if a tax amount was set in PayPal.
* BUG: Fixed setting in PayPal/PayPal Express API calls from AUTOBILLAMT to AUTOBILLOUTAMT. This setting is set to AddToNextBilling, meaning that failed payment amounts are added to the next billing cycle's amount if left unpaid. In most cases, a retry of the original billed amount goes through or the user's subscription is cancelled. But just in case, this makes sure that outstanding balances are paid. (Thanks, jubstuff on GitHub)
* BUG/ENHANCEMENT: Moved the pmpro_before_change_membership_level hook to fire a little bit earlier to make it easier to determine the old level status/end date/etc before it gets updated. (Thanks, MrVibe on GitHub)
* BUG: Fixed warnings in the setGateway method of the MemberOrder class for cases where the gateway is missing or the class file is not found.
* ENHANCEMENT: Replaced the Force SSL option with an explanation if the entire site is over HTTPS. We are already ignoring the option in these cases.

= 1.8.11.2 =
* BUG: Fixed a bug introduced in 1.8.11 that kept PMPro from tracking coupon code uses. Any checkout with a discount code while running 1.8.11 won't have properly tracked the discount code use. You may want to adjust your "uses" numbers for your codes, and hand check any reporting/etc that relied on discount codes. Users of the Sponsored Members addon will have been affected too. Discount codes will need to be made manually for any sponsor who checked out.
* BUG: Fix to the expiration warnings code. Making sure it finds all members who are expiring soon while also keeping track of when emails are sent so users don't get too many emails.
* BUG: Fixed issue where pmpro_before_change_membership_level was running after levels had been changed.
* BUG: Fixed some warnings.
* ENHANCEMENT: Updated Italian translations. (Thanks, Angelo)

= 1.8.11.1 =
* BUG: Fixed issue introduced in 1.8.11 where the pmpro_default_level custom field was being ignored at checkout.
* BUG: Fixed bugs in DB calls made for the compatibility checks for various gateways.
* BUG: Now sending a FREQUENCY parameter for PayPal Payflow orders.

= 1.8.11 =
* BUG: Fixed URL used when checking for addon updates.
* BUG: Now enqueueing the jquery.creditCardValidator.js file in Billing preheader.
* BUG: Fixed issues where PayPal IPN updates would sometimes log $0 instead of the actual billing amount.
* BUG: Fixed warnings in the PayPal IPN handler.
* BUG/ENHANCEMENT: Added pmpro_checkout_level filter and now using that filter to apply the_content filters to the level description at checkout. This allows you to turn off the the_content filters (e.g. processing shortcodes) by using remove_filter('pmpro_checkout_level', 'pmpro_pmpro_checkout_level'); in a custom plugin.
* BUG/ENHANCEMENT: Using the pmpro_confirmation_message filter on the confirmation page whether there is an invoice or not. Now also adding the the_content filters to the confirmation message. You can disable this by using remove_filter('pmpro_confirmation_message', 'pmpro_pmpro_confirmation_message'); in a custom plugin.
* ENHANCEMENT: Now tracking IPN event ids in order notes for recurring orders.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added pmpro_subscription_ipn_event_processed hook to IPN handler.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added pmpro_set_message filter to edit PMPro error messages. Passes the message and type.
* ENHANCEMENT: Now listing categories in hierarchical format in the Content Settings section of Membership Levels.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added pmpro_areLevelsFree() function to check if all levels in an array of levels are free.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added pmpro_getLevelsCost() - with an s - function to get the combined cost of multiple levels in an array.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added pmpro_getLevelsExpiration() - with an s - function to get the combined expiration text for multiple levels in array.
* ENHANCEMENT: Created the pmpro_getLevelAtCheckout function that modularizes some of the logic of creating the pmpro_level global at checkout.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added pmpro_members_list_user filter used on the admin members list and members list CSV export.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added a 4th parameter $cancel_level to pmpro_changeMembershipLevel(). If set, that level will definitely be cancelled locally and at the gateway. This parameter is also passed to the pmpro_before_change_membership_level and pmpro_after_change_membership_level hook.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added a new function pmpro_cancelMembershipLevel($level_id, $user_id, $old_level_status) that acts as a wrapper to pass the $cancel_level param to pmpro_changeMembershipLevel().
* ENHANCEMENT: Updated the cancel page on the frontend to support the Multiple Memberships per User addon. All memberships are shown. You can cancel individual memberships separately. The language of the confirm button mentions memberships vs account.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added pmpro_getMemberOrdersByCheckoutID($checkout_id) function to support Multiple Memberships per User and others using the checkout_id.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added a refund($order, $transaction_id) method to the PMPro_stripe class. This will be used by the Multiple Memberships per User addon and eventually used in other areas by the core pluginn.

= 1.8.10.4 =
* BUG: Fixed issue where non-decimal currencies (e.g. Japanese Yen) were sending invalid amounts to the Stripe gateway.
* BUG/ENHANCEMENT: If an invalid discount code is applied at checkout, we now set the code_level JS var to false. Along with updates to the Pay by Check addon, this fixes issues with the Pay by Check addon where users could not checkout when using a discount code that reduced the price to free.
* BUG/ENHANCEMENT: Fixed HTML validation issue in CVV field of the checkout page.
* BUG/ENHANCEMENT: Now using the current_time function in profile.php to avoid off-by-one errors when changing members' expiration dates.

= 1.8.10.3 =
* BUG: Fixed bug where users could not confirm PayPal Express payments if the main gateway was Stripe or Braintree.
* BUG: Fixed issue where the billing address and/or credit card fields were not showing up on the Update Billing page.

= 1.8.10.2 =
* BUG: Fixed bug in invoices query in the pmpro_account shortcode.
* BUG: Fixed issue where the orders table was not being created on brand new installs.
* BUG: Fixed responsive styling of ReCaptcha.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added Hebrew language support. Thanks, Nadav Waisbrod.

* ENHANCEMENT: Added a text domain and path to the plugin header.

= 1.8.10.1 =
* BUG: Fixed bugs in pmpro_hasMembershipLevel that caused shortcodes like [membership levels="0"] and [membership levels="-1"] to stop working.

= 1.8.10 =
* SECURITY: Patched a cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability on the Memberships -> Addons page in the dashboard. Thanks to Burak Kelebek for the discovery and responsible disclosure of this vulnerability.
* BUG: Added pmpro_btn-submit-checkout class to the PayPal checkout buttons.
* BUG: Updated Stripe and Braintree gateways to load billing fields and JavaScript when it's the default gateway (if not the current gateway specified).
* BUG: Fixed bug where cancelation emails weren't being sent to users if they originated from PayPal.
* BUG: Fixed bug where unsucessful invoices were shown on the Membership Account page. We aren't showing refunded invoices here now either, but plan to in the future.
* BUG: The update billing page now uses the pmpro_include_billing_address_fields filter so gateways and addons can properly override the payment fields when needed.
* BUG: The update billing page now uses the validatecreditcard.js script to set the Card Type in the background, just like checkout. Fixes some issues with updating credit cards on certain gateways.
* BUG: Reintroduced the pmpro_members_list_sql filter.
* BUG/ENHANCEMENT: Switched the Japanese Yen and South Korean Won to not use decimals by default. (Thanks, flatworld21 on wp.org)
* ENHANCEMENT: Added an option to skip the confirmation step with PayPal Express.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added the pmpro_membership_levels_table filter on the membership levels page of the dashboard to allow addons (like the upcoming MMPU addon) to override the HTML for the table shown.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added the checkout_id column to the pmpro_membership_orders table. This will be used by addons and possible core in the future to track multiple orders that happen during the same checkout process.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added support for the Serian language. (Thanks, Sasa Trifkovic)
* NOTE: We are planning to remove the certificate_id and certificate_amount columns from the pmpro_membership_orders table. Please contact us if you are using this column for something to come up with a work around.

= 1.8.9.3 =
* BUG: Fixed bug introduced in 1.8.9.2 where member start and end dates weren't being set correctly. Includes an update script to fix past users affected by this.
* BUG: Fixed warnings on new order page in the dashboard.
* BUG/ENHANCEMENT: Fixed the pmpro_checkout_default_submit_button() methods of the PayPal Express to no longer check if the current gateway is a paypal one. The method is only called when the gateway is loaded anyway or when another addon (e.g. the pmpro-pay-by-check addon) adds the hook.
* BUG/ENHANCEMENT: Moved check instructions code into the check gateway class so it can be overriden by addons (e.g. an update to the pmpro-pay-by-check addon).

= 1.8.9.2 =
* BUG: Fixed SQL in pmpro_changeMembershipLevel that caused issues with some MySQL setups.
* BUG: Fixed URL PayPal Express and PayPal standard redirect to at checkout. (Although the incorrect URL was still working on the PayPal side.)

= 1.8.9.1 =
* BUG: Fixed bug where some recurring orders members who checked out with Stripe in very old versions of PMPro would show up as orders with a blank user_id and membership_id. This update includes a fix for this and an update script to fix old orders affected by this.
* BUG: Fixed bug where the Stripe class activation/deactivation methods were setup too late to actually run on activation/deactivation.
* BUG: Updated the Stripe class to use the same language and markup in the Payment Information section as the default checkout.
* BUG: Now forcing pmpro_getMembershipLevelForUser() in admin change emails.
* BUG: Fixed warning in comments_array and comments_open filters. (Thanks, Mihail Chepovskiy)

* BUG/ENHANCEMENT: Updated URL used in the IPN Handler API calls to match the latest PayPal docs. (Thanks, pbaylies)
* BUG/ENHANCEMENT: Overhauled the orders list CSV export for improved performance. There is still scaling work to be done on the exports, but timeouts and memory errors will happen much less often.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added Greek (el_GR) translation. (Thanks, Alexandros Karypidis)
* ENHANCEMENT: Added $order as a parameter to the pmpro_orders_user_row_actions hook. (Thanks, SquareLines)

* BUG: Fixed bug where the address/street wasn't showing up when printing orders from the dashboard.
* BUG: Fixed bug where the Stripe class would sometimes show its billing and payment fields even if a secondary gateway was chosen.
* BUG: Making sure $this->total is set for new orders and available to the pmpro_add_order, pmpro_added_order filters.
* BUG: Fixed bug where email templates were not being loaded out of the /paid-memberships-pro/languages/email/ directory. (Thanks, menardmam on wordpress.org)
* BUG: No longer showing a "renew" link on the membership account or membership levels pages if the user's level is not allowing sign ups.
* BUG: Fixed bug where the expiration script might try to run on deleted or expired users.
* BUG/ENHANCEMENT: Change membership shortcode to call pmpro_hasMembershipLevel when checking for level="" as well. This ensures the pmpro_has_membership_level filter runs, which some addons/etc need.
* ENHANCEMENT: Updated categories list on the edit levels page to show nested categories.
* ENHANCEMENT: Now adding a pmpro-no-access class (similar to the pmpro-has-access class) to the post element if a user doesn't have access to that post.

* ENHANCEMENT: Refactored the members list CSV to use less memory and scale better. It should work faster in general and better on large sites. (Thanks, Thomas Sjolshagen)
* ENHANCEMENT: Added pmpro_reports_signups_sql and pmpro_reports_get_cancellations_sql filters to filter SQL that generates cancellation numbers in reports.
* ENHANCEMENT: Now setting the timeout on PayPal API calls to 60 seconds from 5 seconds.
* ENHANCEMENT: Now checking admin capabilities on each load in the dashboard in case PMPro-related admin capabilities have been changed. This avoids issues where users were upgrading PMPro but wouldn't have access to updates or new features without deactivating and reactivating PMPro.

* ENHANCEMENT: Added Catalan translations (ca, ca_AD, ca_ES). (Thanks, Jordi Martín)

* BUG: The pmpro_cron_credit_card_expiring_warnings cron job setup by PMPro needed a monthly schedule added via the cron_schedules filter.

* ENHANCEMENT: Added a script that will run on upgrade to clean out old cron jobs.

= 1.8.7.2 =
* BUG: Fixed bug where pmpro_activation() was firing on every page load. (Thanks, Tigertech and MegaZ on WordPress.org)

= 1.8.7.1 =
* BUG: Added missing files via svn.

= 1.8.7 =
* BUG: Fixed bug where recurring Stripe orders were saving the customer ID in the subscription_transaction_id instead of the subscription ID. This was causing issues with plugins like AffiliateWP that tried to track recurring orders. After upgrading to 1.8.7, a script will run on your database to fix old recurring orders.
* BUG: Fixed bug where cancellations weren't showing up in the chart views of the membership stats reports.
* BUG/ENHANCEMENT: The IPN service will now look for the payment_date parameter to set the timestamp of the recurring order/etc when processing IPN requests.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added tools to run large database updates (e.g. Stripe fix above) over AJAX to avoid timeouts.

* ENHANCEMENT: Added Argentine Peso (ARS) as a currency.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added Nigerian Naira as a currency option. (Thanks, Maria)
* ENHANCEMENT: Added a second option $conjunction parameter to the pmpro_implodeToEnglish() function. So you can use pmpro_implodeToEnglish($array, 'or') to change the 'and' in the text to 'or' or something different.
* ENHANCEMENT: The "Sales" numbers on the sales and revenue reports now only includes orders with totals > $0. (More reports updates in the works.)

* BUG: Fixed bug in the Payflow gateway class that was breaking API calls and checkout.

= 1.8.6.8 =
* BUG/ENHANCEMENT: Adding <!-- comment markup --> to inline JavaScript to avoid issues where themes/plugins were adding formatting into the JavaScript code. (Thanks, Isabelle Couillard)
* BUG: Removed calls to force_ssl_login(), which has been deprecated in WP 4.4+. We are using force_ssl_admin() instead.
* BUG: Fixed issue in pmpro_isLevelExpiringSoon() which controls when "renew" links are shown to users. (Thanks, Thomas Sjolshagen)
* ENHANCEMENT: Updated PayPal gateway classes to use the WP HTTP API instead of CURL directly.

= 1.8.6.7 =
* BUG: Fixed issue with prices over $1000 when using TwoCheckout. (Thanks, BigBradBrown and others.)
* ENHANCEMENT: Removed the API Private Key option from 2Checkout setup since we don't actually use that in the API.
* ENHANCEMENT: Using the pmpro_check_status_after_checkout filter to set the status of orders for recurring check payments in addition to one time payments. This update supports the update Pay by Check Add On v.5.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added +1 to timestamp when the pmpro_cron_expiration_warnings cron is scheduled to make sure it runs after the pmpro_cron_expire_memberships cron.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added email templates for Greek translation. (Thanks, Dimitris Kalliris)

* BUG: Fixed issue introduced in 1.8.6.5 where "Please enter all required fields" errors would show up even for free/etc levels at checkout.

= 1.8.6.5 =
* BUG: Now checking for required fields even if $pmpro_requirebilling is not set.

* BUG: Fixed issue where filters stopped working on the orders page in the dashboard.
* BUG: Fixed issue in pmpro_isLevelExpiringSoon that caused the "renew" link to not appear sometimes. (Thanks, xzistance3)
* BUG: Fixed wording of level cost text for levels with billing limits and billing periods with cycles > 1, e.g. "$1 now and then $1 every 2 Months for 2 periods". Thanks, russell77)

= 1.8.6.4 =
* BUG/ENHANCEMENT: Now expiring members before sending expiration warnings.
* BUG: Now adding a specific user agent to IPN requests to PayPal (and other gateways) to avoid 403 errors.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added a constant PMPRO_USER_AGENT used in all outside HTTP requests. The user agent will look like "Paid Memberships Pro v1.8.6.4;http://yourdomain.com".

= 1.8.6.3 =
